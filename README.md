Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) configuration.

Sounds boring. Let's try again.

__Oh My Zsh will not make you a 10x developer...but you may feel like one.__

Once installed, your terminal shell will become the talk of the town _or your money back!_ With each keystroke in your command prompt, you'll take advantage of the hundreds of powerful plugins and beautiful themes. Strangers will come up to you in cafÃ©s and ask you, _"that is amazing! are you some sort of genius?"_

Finally, you'll begin to get the sort of attention that you have always felt you deserved. ...or maybe you'll use the time that you're saving to start flossing more often. ðŸ˜¬
